Sentiment analysis of tweets mentioning major airlines

Parveen Banu Mohammed also contributed to this project.

Executive Summary

Despite generating over $222 billion in revenue in 2017, the U.S. airline industry is among the least liked service-oriented industries in the U.S. (Statista, 2018; Grant, 2014). It’s an impossible task to satisfy every one of America’s 630 million air travelers each year because life, and especially the weather can be unpredictable. Nonetheless, effective customer service remains a key success factor for the airline business. As one of the most competitive industries in the U.S., airlines are under considerable pressure to provide a satisfactory travel experience or they risk a significant decline in revenue. 
Further, the rise of social media has not made an already difficult job any easier. Before the advent of social networking sites like Twitter, if something bad happened on a flight customers may tell a neighbor or two, but now complaints can now be socialized, amplifying the sound of one voice and occasionally leading to a global media event.
Within this context, our team used text mining tools to analyze over 14 thousand tweets published by airline travelers in February of 2014. Our team’s sentiment analysis seeks to provide airlines with the big data tools necessary to analyze the large volume of interaction today’s major airline brands generate on social media while simeotaneously providing insight as to the feelings behind each customer’s experience.
Key Findings
- Our team managed to produce models will allow sponsors of this project to do two things:
- Understand how competitors in the industry compare in terms of customer satisfaction measured by a ratio of negative to non-negative mentions on Twitter, and
- Monitor how well your customer service staff is performing going forward.
